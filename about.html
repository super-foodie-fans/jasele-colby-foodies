   <div class="section-title">About WTFoodie</div>

   <p class="about-us-content">
      In 2019, two Lambda School students broke away from the class to begin working on a project that would change the way that people thought about food and recipes. Jashele Tillman and Colby Howell were just a couple of foodies that bonded over their love of cooking and eating. In just two short weeks, WTFoodie was born.<br><br>

      They had no idea what they were getting themselves into whenever the application devlopment began, but over the course of those two short weeks, WTFoodie took shape and was released onto the mobile and web markets for the world to see... and see they did.<br><br>
      
      In just a few short days, the application gained incredible traction and 50,000 people signed up for the ULTIMATE pricing plan. Jashele and Colby became millionaires overnight. A team of 20 programmers, community managers, and a professional chef was brought on board to handle this incredible influx of users. WTFoodie is constantly hiring new employees. Apply for a career today by visiting the WTFoodie app and choose APPLY at the bottom.<br><br>
      
      As of today, the application gains about 1,000 new users a day and is the sinle most successful food based social media application in the world.<br><br>
